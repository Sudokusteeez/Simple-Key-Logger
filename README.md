# Simple-Key-Logger

Description
The Keylogger project is a Python-based tool for logging keystrokes, which can be beneficial for debugging or security research. It accurately tracks and records user keystrokes, storing the data in a local .txt file. The keylogger serves as a valuable resource for debugging purposes, security analysis, or investigative tasks by providing insights into user input and behavior.

Languages & Libraries Used
Python
Visual Studio Code
Pynput & Logging Libraries
